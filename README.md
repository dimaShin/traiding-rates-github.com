This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To start application run

<code>npm start</code>

To run test suites run

<code>npm test</code>

Few words about solution

Initially I was going to show everything I like in react ecosystem in this solution
It is HOCs, recompose, state management with middleware layer and so on.
I even start implementing it, but for such simple application it was overhead and I had to add comments everywhere to explain why I not chose easier solution.

That's why in the final solution is pretty straight forward and there are not much external libraries.

Also I want to ask you not to judge my SVG skills to much. To be honest, it's my first SVG component from scratch.
Maybe text block also better to implement with SVG, but it was ready at the moment when I've decided to switch from rounded borders to SVG this block was ready and it works pretty fine, so I've decided not to change this part

Also, important to mention that there are only few very basic test suites added to the application. Unfortunately I didn't have time to reach high coverage.

Hope you will enjoy my code.
